## Description:

Game Boy CSS is an attempt to replicate the [DMG-01](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) in CSS.

I thought that would be great to have a Gameboy frame for the <a href="https://mateus.digital/el_jamon_volador">El Jamon Volador</a> page,
and I saw it as an opportunity to start to get into making art with CSS.

This is my very first project and I'm very happy with it :)
